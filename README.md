# Wine-Quality-Predictor
This project is a Wine Quality Predictor using a XGBClassifier and Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained on the wineQuality.csv dataset, which includes various features related to the properties of red wine. The project involves getting information about wine data, data visualization, preprocessing, feature engineering ('top quality') and building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine. <br />

# Objectives <br />
The objectives of this project are <br />
To experiment with different classification methods to see the accuracy <br /> 
To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine using Correlation <br />

# Model Training and Testing steps <br />
1  We use Library <br />
2  Loading Data <br />
3  Understanding Data <br />
4  Visualize the data using matplotlib bar chart <br />
5  Feature Selection is done by droping irrelevant features like total sulphur dioxide and free sulphur dioxide <br />
6  Spliting the datasets into training and testing sets <br />
7  training and testing is done by XGBClassifier and Random Forest Classifier <br />
8  Evaluating the Training Accuracy and Validation Accuracy <br />
